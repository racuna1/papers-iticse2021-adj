Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously discussed, we use the following steps for solving a design
 problem in SER334: Analysis, Design, and Justification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Analysis: 
\series default
a translation of the original ill-defined problem into concrete requirements
 that can be evaluated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Design:
\series default
 a solution to the problem being solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Justification: 
\series default
an argument which supports your design as being superior to other potential
 designs which also satisfy the analysis requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In previous activities, we focused on the base notion of the ADJ method,
 as well as took a more focused look at the analysis stage and the notation
 of K to represent knowledge.
 This time, we will look at a single problem involving 
\shape italic
justification
\shape default
 for a given design choice.
 For the time being, we neglect the design aspect of the ADJ method.
 This is for a simple reason: design of a technical solution is the primary
 aspect of most of the coursework you have already completed.

Let the total process load of a system be defined as a set called 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}$
\end_inset

 Let the next burst of each process 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 The constraints are that 
\begin_inset Formula $id$

Task 2 (15 minutes): Justifying a Design Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See the appendix for the problem that you will be working with.
 There is already work on the analysis and design, left for you is the task
 of justifying the design against alternative options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Justifying this problem lends itself to 
\emph on
elimination
\emph default
 (see below) as a tool to justify the design choice.
 Given the five criteria that you might optimize for, it would be helpful
 to go through each and explain why or why not each criterion is or is not
 the best design choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elimination is a simple problem solving tactic, or we might even call it
 a 
\series bold
\emph on
pattern
\series default
\emph default
.
 You have certainly seen it before - perhaps the only new idea is how it
 is structured and written below.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
And then perhaps we might ask ourselves: could we do this for other problem
 solving techniques we know? Would it even be valuable to do such a thing?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For us, a pattern will mean a generic way to solve a problem, that is valid
 for a certain context.
 This may sound familiar - it is similar to the idea of design patterns
 in software engineering.

Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Consider a render farm used to render animated scenes for various applications
 (e.g.
 physics simulations, movies, shows, etc.).
 The owners of the render farm are primarily concerned with optimizing their
 profit for a given render (charging the highest amount that's reasonable
 while minimizing the actual computation time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, it is important to schedule the jobs in such a way that they
 can maximize their profits.
 Which of the five scheduling criteria is most important to optimize for
 in this situation? Analyze the problem, design a choice, and 
\series bold
justify
\series default
 the choice.

Analysis & Assumptions

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Since the render farm's primary goal is to maximize the profits from each
 render, the renders must be ordered in a way that the customer receives
 their final product in the least amount of time as possible.
 Profit is a direct result of the amount the customer paid minus the server
 cost (utilities, rent, misc.
 overhead).
 The amount the customer paid is not adjustable after the fact, therefore
 the existing jobs in the queue must be done in a manner that provides the
 minimum time (therefore power consumption & overhead cost) to get through
 that job after being added to the queue.
 In short, the time that a job finishes is the most sensitive criteria to
 maximizing profits.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
At a given instance, the render farm might have 5-10 renders in the queue
 waiting for CPU time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Approx.
 job size is known ahead of time.

\begin_layout Itemize
Job complexity isn't known ahead of time.
